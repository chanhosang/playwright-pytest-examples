# How to Run?

## Pytest - Basic

To run test in headed mode on different browser (webkit, chrome, firefox):
```
pytest tests/test_web_element.py --headed --browser webkit
```
To run smoke test coverage only on chrome browser:
```
pytest tests/test_web_element.py -m smoke
```
To exclude those test cases that take longer time to complete:
```
pytest tests/test_web_element.py -m 'not intensive' --headed
```

## Pytest - Page Object Model

To run test written in page object model:
```
pytest tests/test_bing_search.py
```

## Pytest-BDD

To run pytest-bdd test and generate cucumber report:
```
pytest tests/step_defs/test_steps_web.py --cucumberjson=reports/cucumber-report.json
```

**Generate Cucumber HTML Report**

If you are running pytest-bdd, it would be beneficial to generate HTML report in BDD style for better collaboration with the team.


You can either use [Cucumber reports Jenkins Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/cucumber-reports/) and publish the HTML report in Jenkins.

or

Use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). package, [cucumber-html-reporter](https://npm.io/package/cucumber-html-reporter) to generate the HTML report by the following command:
```
npm i cucumber-html-reporter
node generate-html-report.js
```


# Quick Tips

To run test in in headed mode:
```
pytest --headed
```

To run test in parallel with 4 workers:
```
pytest -n 4 --dist=loadfile
```
**NOTE**: IN case there are some tests within the same file that need to run in sequence. Therefore, --dist=loadfile

To run test on multiple browsers:
```
pytest --browser chromium --browser webkit --browser firefox
```

To run test and parse variables from a JSON file and command line argument:
```
pytest tests/test_example.py --variables config/environments.json --password=<password>
```
